Hello! I‚Äôm an early-career researcher in Groundwater Hydrology from the cozy coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico. I was a Lecturer and Researcher in Hydrogeology at the [Technische Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/). Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in Groundwater at UC Davis, advised by [Prof. Thomas Harter](https://caes.ucdavis.edu/people/thomas-harter), and at the [USDA Sustainable Agricultral Water Systems (SAWS) Unit](https://www.ars.usda.gov/pacific-west-area/davis-ca/sustainable-agricultural-water-systems-research/), advised by [Dr. Scott Bradford](https://www.ars.usda.gov/pacific-west-area/davis-ca/sustainable-agricultural-water-systems-research/people/scott-a-bradford/) and [Dr. Menberu Meles](https://www.ars.usda.gov/pacific-west-area/davis-ca/sustainable-agricultural-water-systems-research/people/menberu-b-meles/). 

I obtained my Ph.D. in Geology at Gent Universiteit in 2022, in the [Laboratory for Applied Geology and Hydrogeology (LTGH)](https://www.ugent.be/we/geologie/en/research/organization/applied-geology-and-hydrogeology) advised by [Prof. Emeritus Kristine Walraevens](https://research.ugent.be/web/person/kristine-walraevens-0/en) and at the [Belgian Nuclear Research Centre](https://www.sckcen.be/en/hydrogeology) advised by [Dr. Bart Rogiers](https://rogiersbart.github.io/), [Dr. Koen Beerten](https://researchportal.sckcen.be/en/persons/koen-beerten) and [Laurent Wouters](https://be.linkedin.com/in/laurent-wouters-37865338). I obtained my MSc. in Hydrology and Water Resources in 2018 at the [UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education](https://www.un-ihe.org/) advised by [Prof. Yangxiao Zhou](https://www.un-ihe.org/people/staff/yangxiao-zhou) and [Prof. Tibor Stigter](https://www.un-ihe.org/people/staff/tibor-stigter) and my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering in 2014 from the [Instituto Tecnologico de La Paz](https://lapaz.tecnm.mx/).   

My research sits at the intersection of hydrogeology, integrated modeling, and sustainable water resource management, with a focus on addressing water scarcity and groundwater resilience in arid, drought-prone regions. I develop high-resolution, advanced process-based models that integrate environmental tracers, machine learning, and vadose zone dynamics to reduce uncertainty in recharge estimates, simulate contaminant transport, and guide Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) design. My proposed research agenda, centered on the SWaRM program (Sustainable Water Resource Management), pursues a multi-axial approach: innovating in data characterization and assimilation (e.g., DTS, Age Tracers, AEM), advancing groundwater-surface water modeling (e.g., coupled MODFLOW-HYDRUS and integrated frameworks), and enabling integrated, multi-process multi-scale exploration through Bayesian and deep learning techniques. I am committed to open science, transparent model development, and interdisciplinary engagement to co-produce actionable knowledge with stakeholders. This includes integrating hydro-economic analysis and governance studies to assess the cost-effectiveness and equity of groundwater strategies. From California‚Äôs Central Valley to arid regions in Mexico and sub-Saharan Africa, my goal is to develop adaptive, equitable, and scientifically grounded groundwater governance strategies that bridge modeling innovation and policy relevance.

I bring over 8 years of experience in groundwater modeling, hydrogeological characterization, and exploration, having worked across academic and applied research settings. I'm an energetic, detail-oriented, and highly organized collaborator who believes in interdisciplinary, interactive and fun teams. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, swimming, spending time in nature, and sharing good moments with friends and family.

This space is a reflection of both my scientific interests and who I am beyond the lab. Expect posts mainly on hydrogeology and water science üåä, but potentially also on cooking experiments ü•ò, snapshots from my travels üåç, plant musings üåø, and perhaps even chapters from a sci-fi story I‚Äôve been drafting üìö. I believe in science, creativity, and staying human, and this site is my small attempt at keeping all of that in balance üêã.
