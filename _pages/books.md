> I am building an interdisciplinary research group focused on groundwater resilience, managed aquifer recharge (MAR), and data-informed water governance. Our group works at the intersection of hydrogeology, environmental modeling, machine learning, and socio-economic analysis to support sustainable and equitable groundwater use. If you are interested in joining as a graduate student or postdoctoral researcher, please see the sections below. I especially welcome applicants from diverse backgrounds and with interdisciplinary interests.
<br/>

#### ***Prospective Ph.D. Students***
I am recruiting one or two Ph.D. students to begin in Spring 2026 or Fall 2026, depending on mutual availability and alignment. Strong applicants should have a degree (B.S. or M.S.) in Civil or Environmental Engineering, Hydrology, Geology, Earth Sciences, or a related field, and a demonstrated interest in groundwater science and modeling.

Relevant research areas include:
- Numerical groundwater and vadose zone modeling (e.g., MODFLOW, HYDRUS)
- Machine learning or deep learning for model-data integration and decision support
- Groundwater‚Äìsurface water interactions and coupled hydrologic systems
- DTS (Distributed Temperature Sensing) and environmental tracers for recharge estimation
- AEM (Airborne Electromagnetics) and hydrogeophysical data assimilation
- Saltwater intrusion modeling and coastal aquifer management
- Hydro-economics and policy-relevant groundwater governance frameworks

Preferred qualifications:
- Programming skills (e.g., Python, R)
- Experience with fieldwork or spatial datasets
- Interest in stakeholder engagement and interdisciplinary collaboration

To apply, submit your materials through the UCLA CEE Ph.D. admissions portal [https://www.cee.ucla.edu/graduate-admissions/] and mention my name in your Statement of Purpose. After submission, email me with the subject line ‚ÄúProspective Ph.D. Student ‚Äì YOUR NAME‚Äù, attaching your CV and a brief research interest statement.

Spring 2026 applicants should apply during the 2025‚Äì2026 cycle, which closes in August 2025. For Fall 2026, the portal opens in September 2025, with a deadline of December 15, 2025.
<br/>

#### ***Prospective Master‚Äôs Students***
I may supervise M.S. students starting as early as Fall 2025, though most positions will begin in Spring 2026. Suitable applicants will have a background in engineering, hydrology, environmental science, or a related discipline and a strong interest in applied groundwater topics.

Possible M.S. research areas include:
- Groundwater recharge and MAR performance assessment
- Coupled surface‚Äìsubsurface modeling
- Machine learning or decision support tools for water management
- Salt water intrusion and contaminant transport modeling
- Environmental tracer and AEM/DTS integration for aquifer characterization

Prior research or programming experience is preferred but not required. If you plan to apply to the M.S. program in CEE at UCLA, please mention my name in your application and send me a CV and a short note describing your interests.
<br/>

#### ***Postdoctoral Scholars***
I am open to hosting a postdoctoral researcher with expertise in one or more of the following: high-resolution groundwater modeling, vadose zone hydrology, inverse modeling, machine learning, hydrogeophysics (e.g., AEM), or hydro-economic analysis.

Candidates should have:
- A Ph.D. in Civil/Environmental Engineering, Hydrology, Geosciences, or a related field
- A publication record in relevant areas
- Proficiency in scientific programming (Python, R, MATLAB, etc.)
- Strong communication skills and interest in mentoring and interdisciplinary collaboration

Interested applicants should email me with the subject line ‚ÄúProspective Postdoc ‚Äì YOUR NAME‚Äù, and include a CV, a 1‚Äì2 page research statement outlining past work and future interests, and links to any relevant publications.
<br/>

> I value collaboration, curiosity, and scientific relevance. If your interests overlap with the research vision of our group, even if you‚Äôre unsure about fit, feel free to reach out! üöÄ
