I defended my PhD dissertation entitled *'Assessment of unconventional state variables to constrain groundwater flow models of the Neogene Aquifer in the Campine Basin in Belgium'*, at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en). You may find a copy of the dissertation in the [repository](https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8771046) of Ghent University or in my [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364734656_Assessment_of_unconventional_state_variables_to_constrain_groundwater_flow_models_of_the_Neogene_Aquifer_in_the_Campine_Basin_in_Belgium) page.
